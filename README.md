# Login Page

- In this project, I'll create a login page using the MERN stack
- TO RUN:
  - Go to auth/server directory and create a ".env" file
    - Structure it as such:\
      DB = < link to your mongodb database here >\
      JWTPRIVATEKEY = < your JSON web token private key here >\
      SALT = < any number of your choosing (for encryption purposes) >
    - Go to both the auth/server directory and the client directory and run "npm
      install", for any packages that are needed
    - Finally, run "npm start" within both the client and server file to get the
      site up and running.
